#üîç Project Overview:

I'm excited to share my recent project where I explored the fascinating intersection of communication and technology. Using an Arduino Nano, a laser, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and a resistor, I successfully transmitted Morse code through Li-Fi (Light Fidelity). To enhance user experience, I developed a Python-based GUI to display the received text.

#üõ† Components Used:

Arduino Nano: The brain of the project, used for coding and controlling the transmission.
Laser: Acts as the transmitter, sending out the Morse code signals in the form of light pulses.
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): The receiver, detecting the light pulses and converting them into readable signals.
Resistor: To manage the current in the circuit and protect components.
Python GUI: For a user-friendly interface to display the decoded Morse code.

#üìö How It Works:

Encoding Morse Code: The Arduino Nano is programmed to convert text into Morse code.
Transmitting Signal: The encoded Morse code is transmitted using a laser, emitting light pulses.
Receiving Signal: The LDR captures the light pulses, which are then decoded back into text by the Arduino.
Displaying Text: The decoded text is sent to a Python-based GUI, which visually represents the received message in real-time.


#üí°Key Takeaways:

Innovation in Communication: This project demonstrates how Li-Fi can be used for data transmission in a unique and efficient way.
Hands-On Learning: Working with Arduino, basic electronic components, and Python deepens understanding of both hardware and software aspects of communication technologies.
Future Potential: Li-Fi has potential applications in various fields such as secure communications, underwater data transfer, and more.
